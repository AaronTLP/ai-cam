  heading: We need a new infrastructure for interdisciplinary AI innovation.
  content: Amidst fevered conversations about progress in AI, the foundational
    work to connect technology development to public value is more important
    than ever. Progress in AI research and innovation can provide tools to help
    tackle the complex challenges society faces – in economic growth, health and
    social care, environment and wellbeing, and more. To deliver on this
    promise, AI research and development needs to connect to public interests,
    concerns, and areas of need.
