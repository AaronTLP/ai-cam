    Amidst fevered conversations about progress in AI, the foundational work to
    connect technology development to public value is more important than ever.
    Progress in AI research and innovation can provide tools to help tackle the
    complex challenges society faces – in economic growth, health and social
    care, environment and wellbeing, and more. To deliver on this promise, AI
    research and development needs to connect to public interests, concerns, and
    areas of need.


    AI@Cam is creating an infrastructure for interdisciplinary AI innovation through research, education, and innovation programmes that leverage the world-leading research already taking place across the University and connecting this to real-world needs.
