name: William Sutherland
prefix: Professor
biography: As well as a general interest in many aspects of conservation science
  I am especially interested in improving the processes by which decisions are
  made. This has involved horizon scanning to identify future issues to reduce
  the surprises of future developments. My main work has been the
  industrial-scale collation of evidence to determine which interventions are
  effective and which are not and then establishing processes for embedding
  evidence in decision making.  I am also interested in the processes of
  decision making as this is often so clearly flawed.
