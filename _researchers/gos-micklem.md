Gos Micklem runs an interdisciplinary research group, using computational and molecular techniques to carry out basic and applied research related to biology.

A major activity has been working as part of the open source community on projects such as the InterMine data integration platform.

Current interests include:

 - antimicrobial resistance
 - synthetic biology
 - large-scale data integration: [InterMine](http://intermine.org), [HumanMine](https://www.humanmine.org/humanmine), [FlyMine](https://www.flymine.org/flymine)
 - machine learning related to the above: [Polyglotter](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34531510/), SQLformer, [SFAVEL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16540)
