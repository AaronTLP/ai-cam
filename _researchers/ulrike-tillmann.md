biography: >-
  After finishing her early education in Germany, Ulrike Tillmann went to
  Brandeis University as a Wien International Scholar and studied for her PhD
  under Ralph Cohen at Stanford. This was followed by collaborations with Graeme
  Segal in Cambridge before she took her current position in Oxford where she
  is, amongst other roles, the co-director of the Centre for Topological Data
  Analysis and a fellow of Merton College.


  She was awarded the Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society in 2004 and the Bessel Preis by the Humboldt Society in 2008. Elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 2008, she was an inaugural fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012, and became a member of the Leopoldina in 2017. She has also been a fellow of The Alan Turing Institute since its establishment in 2015, and serves on scientific boards of several international institutions, including the Fields Institute and the Austrian Science Foundation. At the end of 2020 she finished her term as a member of Council of the Royal Society where she also served as interim Vice President in 2018.


  Ulrike has worked broadly in topology, K-theory, and non-commutative geometry. Her work on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and manifolds of higher dimensions has been inspired by problems in quantum physics and string theory. Some of her most recent work has been motivated by new and developing challenges in data science.
