Dr Tomasz Hollanek works at the intersection of design theory, technology ethics, and critical artificial intelligence studies. Currently, he is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (LCFI) at Cambridge, where he is a part of the 'AI for Just and Sustainable Futures' project. His ongoing research explores the possibility of applying critical design methods – approaches that prioritize the goals of social justice and environmental sustainability – in the governance, development, deployment of AI systems.
