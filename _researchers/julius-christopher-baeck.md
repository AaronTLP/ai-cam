I am a final year PhD student in Klaus Okkenhaug's Group at the Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge. My work centres around the role of the lipid signalling enzyme PI3KÎ´ in B cell homeostasis and cancer. I generate large datasets to assess cellular phenotypes which triggered my curiosity on how to best utilise AI in biological research.
