Henrik is a professor in the department of genetics where he heads the Pathogen Dynamics Group. Dr. Salje works on the spread of infectious diseases. He uses mathematical, computational and field research to help our understanding of how pathogens spread in populations, to assess control efforts and support policy making. This includes working with a diverse range of datasets including epidemiological, genomic, serological and behavioural data. He works closely with an established network of collaborators across laboratories, field-based epidemiologists, hospitals and public health agencies. Much of his work is in resource poor settings, especially in Asia. He has a particular interest in the dynamics of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses.
