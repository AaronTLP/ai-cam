Katarzyna Nowaczyk-Basińska is a Research Fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence at the University of Cambridge, with a background in cultural and media studies. In her work, she explores how digital technologies (re)shape our understanding of death, loss, grief, and afterlife presence. From 2020 to 2023, she held an individual grant entitled “Immortality: Contemporary Technocultural Strategies,” funded by the Polish National Science Center. She is also a team member of an international scientific consortium, 'Digital Death: Transforming History, Ritual, and Afterlife,' as a part of the EU CHANSE initiative. In 2023, she was nominated for the AI2050 program for Early Career Fellows at Schmidt Futures for her research on the meaning of life and death in the age of AI.
