name: Alexandra Freeman
prefix: Dr
biography: Before joining the Winton Centre in 2016, Alex Freeman had a 16 year
  career at the BBC, working on series such as Walking with Beasts, Life in the
  Undergrowth, Bang Goes the Theory, Climate Change by Numbers and as series
  producer of Trust Me, I’m a Doctor. Her work won a number of awards, from a
  BAFTA to a AAAS Kavli gold award for science journalism. In addition to
  developing and making television series, Alex worked with associated content
  across a whole range of other media – designing websites, games, formal
  learning resources and social media content – to bring science to the widest
  possible audience. Now at the Winton Centre she has a particular interest in
  helping professionals such as doctors, journalists or legal professionals
  communicate numbers and uncertainty better, and in whether narrative can be
  used as a tool to inform but not persuade. She is an advocate of Open Research
  practices and the reform of the science publishing system, and in her spare
  time leads the Octopus platform for primary research publication.
