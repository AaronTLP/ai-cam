  I am a full Professor of Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Computer
  Science and Technology (Computer Laboratory) at the University of Cambridge,
  UK. I am also an associate fellow at the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of
  Intelligence. Recently I served as Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords
  Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence. I founded the women@CL
  initiative.


  I am interested in human intuitive reasoning and want to make computers think intuitively too. I build computational models that capture human informal reasoning - I am essentially trying to humanise computer thinking. I combine AI reasoning with machine learning techniques in order to advance the explainability of AI systems, and apply them to personalise medicine and tutoring systems.


  Broadly, my research is in the areas of artificial intelligence, human-like computation, machine learning, explainability, automated reasoning, diagrammatic reasoning, knowledge representation, theorem proving, cognitive science, human-computer interaction.
