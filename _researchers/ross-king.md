  My main research interest is the automation of scientific research. I
  originated the idea of a ‘Robot Scientist’: a physically implemented
  computer/robotic system that utilises techniques from artificial intelligence
  (AI) to execute cycles of scientific experimentation.  A Robot Scientist can
  in a fully automatic manner: originate hypotheses to explain observations,
  devise experiments to test these hypotheses, physically run the experiments
  using laboratory robotics, interpret the results, and then repeat the cycle.
  My Robot Scientist ‘Adam’ was the first machine to autonomously hypothesise
  and experimentally confirm novel scientific knowledge. My Robot Scientist
  ‘Eve’ automates early-stage drug design, especially for neglected tropical
  diseases such as Malaria, Chagas, etc. Eve integrates and automates
  library-screening, hit-confirmation, and lead generation through cycles of
  quantitative structure activity relationship learning and testing. Using
  econometric modelling, we have demonstrated that the use of AI to select
  compounds economically outperforms standard drug screening


  I am currently developing a 3rd-generation Robot Scientist ‘Genesis’ designed to in parallel automate thousands of closed-loop cycles of experiment. To physically achieve this Genesis will have 10,000 micro-chemostats and associated analytical equipment. The application domain for Genesis is automatically learning computational models of eukaryotic cells. This task is one of the most important and challenging in modern science. It is important because understanding how cells work is fundamental to medicine and biotechnology. It is extremely challenging because even the simple ‘model’ eukaryotic cell yeast (S. cerevisiae) has thousands of different genes, proteins, small molecules, all interacting in complex temporal spatial ways. Constructing high-fidelity models will require many thousands of cycles of designed experiments and model improvement, yet little current systems biology research completes a single cycle of model improvement. 


  I am involved in organising the international ‘Nobel Turing Grand Challenge’ to develop AI Scientists: AI systems capable of making Nobel-quality scientific discoveries highly autonomously at a level comparable, and possibly superior, to the best human scientists by 2050.
