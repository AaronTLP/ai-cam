I am a Director of Research, equivalent to Professor, in the Department of Chemistry, and a researcher in the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) where I am the Training Theme Leader, overseeing the NCAS portfolio of short courses.  I work with the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols (UKCA) community chemistry-aerosol model. This is used within the Met Office modelling infrastructure, and is a collaboration between the Universities of Cambridge, Leeds, Oxford, and the Met Office.  I am interested in chemistry-climate interactions and Earth-system modelling, and UKCA is a core component of the UK Earth System Model, UKESM. Recently I have been working to prepare UKCA for exascale computing systems, as well as improving our ability to compare models with observations, and developing emulators for various aspects of atmospheric chemistry.
