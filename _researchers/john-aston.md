  Harding Professor of Statistics in Public Life


  This professorship, formerly known as the Winton Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk, was generously endowed by The David and Claudia Harding Foundation to undertake research into the use of quantitative evidence in public policy making, and develop new ways to use data in public life and debate. This involves three main aims:

  - developing cutting edge statistical techniques of relevance to public policy

  - working with those in public life to ensure the best quantitative methods are used

  - improving the use of statistics and other quantitiative evidence in public policy debates


  This research is joint with a number of collaborators not least the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication.


  I am co-Director of the Cambridge Mathematics of Information in Healthcare Hub and on the management board of the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information.


  I am also a non-Executive Director of the UK Statistics Authority
