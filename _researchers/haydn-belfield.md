Haydn has been a Research Associate and Academic Project Manager at the University of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk for the past six years. In that time the Centre tripled in size, and he advised the UK, US, and Singaporean governments; the EU, UN and OECD; and leading technology companies. He has over 40 publications with over 1,300 citations, including on climate change, pandemics, and societal collapse, but most of his work is on the security implications of artificial intelligence (AI). He is co-Chair of the Global Politics of AI Project and a Research Fellow at the international Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence.
