  I am a member of the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, where I am also
  the Training Theme Leader, working at the Centre for Atmospheric Science in
  the Department. From October 2023 I will be a Director of Research in the
  Department, equivalent to Professor (Grade 12).


  I work with the United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols community chemistry-aerosol-climate model. This is based on the Met Office Unified Model, and is a collaboration between the Universities of Cambridge, Leeds, Oxford, and the Met Office.


  I am a Fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute and have written blogs on how to use virtual machines for training and the benefits of in-person training, as well as co-authoring a blog on how to write good research software. I was also interviewed by the Naked Scientists podcast, discussing climate modelling and what can go wrong and how to fix it.


  I am a member of NCAS Computational Modelling Services and provide model support for UKCA on both ARCHER2 and Monsoon2. If you require support please raise a ticket with the CMS Helpdesk, or if you would like to know more about UKCA in general, please email me, or browse through the UKCA wiki. This provides information about the model, the standard jobs that are available, publications using the model, and also a tutorial covering how to get started with the model and add in new chemistry, emissions, species etc.
