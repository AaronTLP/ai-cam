  My expertise is in atomistic simulation, particularly in multi scale modelling
  that couples quantum mechanics to larger length scales. I am currently engaged
  in applying machine learning and other data intensive techniques to materials
  modelling problems, such as deriving force fields (interatomic potentials)
  from ab initio electronic structure data. Also interested in statistical
  problems in molecular dynamics, e.g. in enhanced sampling algorithms that can
  be used explore the global configuration space of materials and molecules. 


  I help run the Lennard-Jones Centre, which has a seminar series where we often discuss the application of machine learning to physics, chemistry and materials science problems.
