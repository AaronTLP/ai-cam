prefix: Professor
biography: Simon Godsill is Professor of Statistical Signal Processing in the
  Engineering Department at Cambridge University.  He is also a Professorial
  Fellow and tutor at Corpus Christi College Cambridge.  He coordinates an
  active research group in Signal Inference and its Applications within the
  Signal Processing and Communications Laboratory at Cambridge, specializing in
  Bayesian computational methodology, multiple object tracking, audio and music
  processing, and financial time series modeling. A particular methodological
  theme over recent years has been the development of novel techniques  for
  optimal Bayesian filtering and smoothing, using Sequential Monte Carlo or
  Particle Filtering methods.  Prof. Godsill has published extensively in
  journals, books and international conference proceedings, and has given a
  number of high profile invited and plenary addresses at conferences such as
  the Valencia  conference on Bayesian Statistics, the IEEE Statistical Signal
  Processing Workshop and the Conference on Bayesian Inference for Stochasrtic
  Processes (BISP). He co-authored a seminal Springer text Digital Audio
  Restoration with Prof. Peter Rayner in 1998. He was technical chair of the
  successful IEEE NSSPW workshop in 2006 on sequential and nonlinear filtering
  methods, and has been on the conference panel for numerous other
  conferences/workshops. Prof. Godsill has served as Associate Editor for IEEE
  Tr. Signal Processing and the journal Bayesian Analysis. He was Theme Leader
  in Tracking and Reasoning over Time for the UKâ€™s Data and Information Fusion
  Defence Technology Centre (DIF-DTC) and Principal Investigator on many grants
  funded by the EU, EPSRC, QinetiQ, General Dynamics, MOD, Microsoft UK,
  Citibank and Mastercard. In 2009-10 he was co-organiser of an 18 month
  research program in Sequential Monte Carlo Methods at the SAMSI Institute in
  North Carolina. He is a Director of CEDAR Audio Ltd. (which has received
  numerous accolades over the years, including a technical Oscar).
