biography: >-
  I am an Environmental Data Scientist, Leader of the Artificial Intelligence
  (AI) Lab at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), and a Senior Research Fellow
  at The Alan Turing Institute. I am also a Co-Director for the University of
  Cambridge and BAS Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in the Application of AI
  to the study of Environmental Risks (AI4ER), a Â£6m UKRI funded programme to
  train over 50 top students to become future global leaders in environmental
  science.


  My team focuses on the development of AI and data science methods for understanding, monitoring and predicting environmental change. More specifically, my projects involve: the intelligent fusion of data from satellite and in-situ surface sensors to help understand our changing planet; probabilistic machine learning for localised climate impacts, including future heatwaves and water security; AI for seasonal sea ice forecasting and improving climate models; and computer vision toolkits for tracking environmental change and wildlife monitoring.


  The overarching aim of my research is in developing Digital Twins of the natural environment to improve scientific understanding and aid decision making. The digital twinning frameworks are designed to work across varying spatial and temporal scales, and geographies (from urban environments up to the Antarctic continent), and also the BAS ships and automated vehicles.


  I serve on the steering committee to manage the operational alliance between The Alan Turing Institute and the UK Met Office, and as a board member for the Cambridge Centre for Climate Science.
