biography: My research in cognitive computational neuroscience sits at the interface
  of computational science and neuroscience. My experimental work aims to understand
  the role of lifelong learning and brain plasticity in enabling individuals of all
  ages to flexibly adapt to new settings and challenges. My computational work aims
  to develop predictive AI-guided models of brain and mental health with translational
  impact in early diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders and personalised interventions.
  I am a Royal Society Industry Fellow, Co-director of Cambridgeâ€™s Centre for Data
  Driven Discovery, Fellow and Cambridge University Lead at the Alan Turing Institute.
