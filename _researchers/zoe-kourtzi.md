My research in cognitive computational neuroscience sits at the interface of computational science and neuroscience. My experimental work aims to understand the role of lifelong learning and brain plasticity in enabling individuals of all ages to flexibly adapt to new settings and challenges. My computational work aims to develop predictive AI-guided models of brain and mental health with translational impact in early diagnosis of neurocognitive disorders and personalised interventions. I am a Royal Society Industry Fellow, Co-director of Cambridgeâ€™s Centre for Data Driven Discovery, Fellow and Cambridge University Lead at the Alan Turing Institute.
