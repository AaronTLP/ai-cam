biography: My work aims to understand the role of learning and experience in
  enabling humans of all ages to translate sensory experience into complex
  decisions and adaptive behaviours. Adaptive cognitive abilities are critical
  for survival and social interactions, yet extracting meaning from the complex,
  and frequently ambiguous, input of the natural world is a computationally
  demanding task that is far from understood. I address this challenge through
  an interdisciplinary approach that combines behavioural paradigms with
  multimodal brain imaging (MRI, EEG, MEG, TMS) and state-of-the-art
  computational methods. I apply these techniques to study the young and ageing
  brain and understand learning and cortical plasticity across the lifespan.
