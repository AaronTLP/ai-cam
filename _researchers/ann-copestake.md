biography: >-
  Ann Copestake is Professor of Computational Linguistics. Her research involves
  developing computer models of human languages (or, more precisely, models of
  some aspects of human languages). In conjunction with DELPH-IN, an informal
  international consortium, she has developed software which has been used to
  develop formal computational accounts of the syntax and compositional
  semantics of many different languages. Apart from DELPH-IN, her current
  research mainly concerns semantics.


  She has worked on a variety of application areas including scientific text processing, information extraction, augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), machine translation, Natural Language Interfaces, lexical acquisition and on tools for lexicographers.
