I'm a research student in Cancer Biology within the CRUK MRes + PhD Programme. Previously I did a Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg (Germany), studying abroad at Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and researching cancer immunology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) in Boston. Ever since doing a lab rotation in single-cell RNA sequencing at EMBL-EBI/Cambridge Pharmacology, I am really interested in the computational side of biology. Since then, I focus on programming rather than pipetting and have been working on the computational side of cancer research since.
