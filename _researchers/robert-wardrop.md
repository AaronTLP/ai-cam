biography: >-
  My research interests include the sociology of financial markets, trust,
  comparative institutionalism, innovation, and entrepreneurship. I’m an
  economic sociologist interested in understanding how and why channels and
  instruments of finance emerge outside the traditional system and how this
  impacts regulators, incumbent financial institutions and consumers. I
  previously had an international career as a professional investor.


  I’m part of the Finance subject group at Cambridge Judge Business School, which focuses on the investment and financial decisions of firms and institutions.
