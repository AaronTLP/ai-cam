I am a social scientist (PhD LSE, 2018) working at the intersection of expert decision-making, risk and technology policy. I am interested in understanding the long-term impacts of frontier AI systems on social and democratic processes and developing interventions that can shape these impacts and mitigate extreme risks. I am also Principal Investigator of the “Measuring the quality of collective reasoning” project, funded by the British Academy and a member of the next generation Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, where I lead the taskforces on expert forecasting and dissent.
