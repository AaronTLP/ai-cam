I started my PhD in 2020, after completing my MRes as part of the CDT. I am co-supervised by Scott Hosking from the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the British Antarctic Survey and Richard Turner from the Machine Learning Group in the Department of Engineering. My research focuses on applying probabilistic machine learning methods to predicting precipitation in mountainous areas such as the Himalayas. Before coming to Cambridge, I completed an integrated masters in Physics at Imperial College London.
