Maya earned a Drphil in Cultural Studies from Leuphana University, Lueneburg, Germany.

Her work is influenced by scholarship and practice in feminist approaches to technoscience, STS, Digital Anthropology, Media Studies, and Critical Data/Algorithm Studies. Her current research is about AI Ethics pedagogy in mediating the relationship between theory and practice. Between 2008-2017, Maya was a researcher working with digital rights organisations at the intersection of gender justice and digital freedom of expression with human rights defenders, activists, and journalists across the majority world.
