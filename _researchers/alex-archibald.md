Professor Alex Archibald is a Lecturer in Atmospheric Chemistry Modelling in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge. His research involves the development and application of state-of-the-art chemistry-climate models. With these models his group is trying to answer a number of questions relevant to society: (i) What are the impacts of changes in man made emissions on the composition of the atmosphere (ii) how does the changing composition of the atmosphere affect climate (iii) how will a changing climate impact the composition of the atmosphere.

Dr Archibald is also a co-ordinator of the Cambridge Centre for Climate Science, which promotes research and other activities in Climate Science going on at several Departments of the University of Cambridge (Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Geography, Plant Sciences and Scott Polar Research Institute) and at the British Antarctic Survey.
