biography: Somenath Bakshi is a new University Lecturer in Synthetic Biology. He
  is a single molecule biophysicist by training. He did his PhD in University of
  Wisconsin Madison under Professor James Weisshaar â€“ developing
  super-resolution imaging technologies to study central cellular processes in
  microbes. After finishing his PhD, he moved to Harvard University for his
  postdoc with Professor Johan Paulsson. During his postdoc Somenath developed
  high-throughput timelapse imaging technologies of single microbes in
  controlled complex growth-conditions. He has also developed a novel
  self-erasable fluorescence barcoding system, which enables harnessing the
  throughput for boosting multiplexing capabilities, without any need for
  cloning and sequencing. Though most of his work has focused on methods and
  approaches to synthetic biology, he remains interested in quantifying the
  dynamics and control of natural circuits. In fact much of the work from his
  postdoc focused on real biological circuits, studying circuits involved in
  stress-response regulation and their impact on persistence of microbes towards
  antibiotics.
