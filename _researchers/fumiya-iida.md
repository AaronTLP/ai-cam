biography: Fumiya Iida is a professor of robotics at the Department of
  Engineering, University of Cambridge. He received his bachelor and master
  degrees in mechanical engineering at Tokyo University of Science (Japan,
  1999), and Dr. sc. nat. in Informatics at University of Zurich (2006). In 2004
  and 2005, he was also engaged in biomechanics research of human locomotion at
  Locomotion Laboratory, University of Jena (Germany). From 2006 to 2009, he
  worked as a postdoctoral associate at the Computer Science and Artificial
  Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology in USA. In
  2006, he was awarded the Fellowship for Prospective Researchers from the Swiss
  National Science Foundation, and in 2009, he was appointed as a Swiss National
  Science Foundation Professor for bio-inspired robotics at ETH Zurich. His
  research interests include biologically inspired robotics, embodied artificial
  intelligence, and biomechanics, and he has been involved in a number of
  research projects related to dynamic legged locomotion, navigation of
  autonomous robots, and human-machine interactions. He has so far published
  over forty publications in major robotics journals and conferences, and edited
  two books. Currently he serves on the editorial board of the Soft Robotics
  Journal, Frontiers in Robotics and AI (Bio-Inspired Robotics Section), and as
  a program committee member for international conferences and workshops. In
  addition, he has organized a few seminal meetings such as the International
  Conference of Embodied Intelligence, RoboSoft, and TAROS.
