After a undergraduate education in Physics and Mathematics, I worked on optimisation problems using neural networks for my PhD at Lund University, Sweden. I then moved towards modelling in Biology as a postdoc at Caltech, CA. I've continued modelling plant development and morphogenesis and have been at the Sainsbury Laboratory since 2011.
