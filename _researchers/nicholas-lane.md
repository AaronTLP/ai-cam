biography: I study the design, architecture and algorithms of scalable and robust
  end-to-end machine learning (ML) systems. My research interests drive towards the
  development of new forms of ML systems that are revolutionary in how they leverage
  multi-modal data (e.g., speech, vision, location, inertial information) to infer
  and reason over complex real-world situations â€” while simultaneously, maintaining
  extreme levels of systems flexibility (e.g., distributed execution, adaptation)
  and efficiency (e.g., compute, memory).
