Join us in our pop-up conversation lab, to meet some of the people working on this technology every day. Do we feel hopeful about the benefits this technology could bring us? Or are there things that feel a bit scary?

From Alexa, to FitBit, to Netflix and ChatGPT - artificial Intelligence is already shaping our daily lives. But now is the time to decide together how it should shape our future.

There are no silly questions in the (cardboard!) lab, just great conversations. And everyone is welcome.

Date: 26 and 27 October

Time: 10:00 - 16:00

Location: The Hopes and Fears Bus, Parker's Piece â€” Cambridge
